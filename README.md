# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification â€“ CodeAlpha Internship (Task 1)

This is Task 1 of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

---

##  Dataset

We used the [Iris dataset], which contains 150 samples with the following features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (label)

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## Project Workflow

1. Load the dataset from a CSV file
2. Clean and prepare the data
3. Encode target labels using `LabelEncoder`
4. Visualize feature relationships using `pairplot`
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
6. Train a classification model using **Random Forest**
7. Evaluate the model using **accuracy score**
8. Display results using **Confusion Matrix**

---

## ðŸ“Š Results

- The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 100%
- Confusion matrix shows correct classification for most samples
